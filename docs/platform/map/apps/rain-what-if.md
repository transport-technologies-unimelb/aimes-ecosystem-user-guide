> **Region availability:** Melbourne, Metropolitan Melbourne

This app allows you to see the changes in volume, speed, and hazard of each Link in the network when the region is raining and not raining.

There are two modes of the analysis:
- Use weather prediction - Here, the precipitation data is taken from our weather prediction. We have up to 6 days ahead of weather prediction.
- Specify scenario manually - Here, you can specify whether the baseline and what-if scenario has raining or dry conditions.

Once you've configured the parameters, click on "Analyse Roads" to initiate the what-if analysis.
This could take 30 to 60 seconds to complete.
