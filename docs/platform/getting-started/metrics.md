# Viewing Metrics

Metrics are statistics about the road network in the selected Region.
This can include the average speed, congestion, hazard, or emission of the entire road network or a polygon.

### Plotting metrics

:::note
Currently, only line chart is supported for Metrics.

First, navigate to the Metrics page using the Navbar. 
On the left, you will see some configuration options.

##### Step 1 - Selecting coverage

You can choose to plot for the entire road network, or a subset of it.

If you select "Draw a polygon", a popup will appear that allows you to draw the polygon.

You can use the "Search Places" button to fly to a particular location.

Click on the map to draw the points.
Then, close the polygon by clicking on the first point that you have placed.

Once the polygon is closed, click on `Make Selection` to make the selection, or `Clear Polygon` to clear the polygon.
