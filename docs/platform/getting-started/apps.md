# Using the Apps

Apps are interactive feature that exclusively takes up the whole map. 
When an App is opened, all other widgets are disabled and the main map is cleared of any other visualisations.

The platform has several Apps you can use. More on apps [here](/category/apps/).

### Opening an App

To open an App, use the Sidebar to navigate to the Apps pane.
You will see a selection of Apps available to you and your selected Region. 

Click on the App name to open.
