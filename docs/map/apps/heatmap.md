### Metrics

Use the top select widget to choose which metric to display.

There are five metrics you can choose:
- Volume
- Speed
- Hazard
- Congestion
- Emission (predicted)

### Subclass

Each metric might have a different set of subclasses.
For example, the "Volume" metric has subclasses that represent 15-minute prediction, up to 180-minute prediction.

Use the bottom select widget to choose the subclass.
