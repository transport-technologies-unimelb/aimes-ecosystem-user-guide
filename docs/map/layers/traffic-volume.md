# Traffic Volume

:::info
Traffic Volume data is currently available only in Melbourne region.
:::

This layer visualises the volume of each Link on the map.
You can choose to view the actual volume (at the selected time), or any volume predictions up to 3 hours ahead.

### Configure shown value

Use the "Shown Value" selector to select which data you want to see.
"Actual" means the actual volume shown at the selected time.
"15-minute prediction" means the predicted volume 15 minutes ahead since the selected time.

Below the selector, there is a text that shows you which time is shown on the map.

:::note
When you select a prediction, the data displayed is NOT at the selected time.
For example, if at 9am you see 30-minute prediction, the maps shows the prediction for 9.30am.
:::


### Configure visualisation

There is an option to represent the value in width.
If you enable this option, links with higher value will have a thicker line than the rest.
This is especially useful when you zoom out the map and see a bigger picture.

The left image shows the map without this option enabled, while the right image shows the map with this option enabled.
