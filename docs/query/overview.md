# Overview

Query is a powerful tool that allows you to create a custom query to visualise and export data on the platform.
You can filter, sort, aggregate, and join static and time series data in a visual and intuitive way.

You can visualise the data into a chart, or export the data to CSV and do your own analysis.

### Building query

See [Building Query](./building-query.md) for details on how to build the query.

### Visualising the data

See [Configuring Visualisation](./configuring-visualisation.md) for details on how to plot the data.

### Exporting the data

After your query has been processed, you should see an "Export CSV" button on the bottom right corner.
Click on that button, and your data will be downloaded in CSV format.
