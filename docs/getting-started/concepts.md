# Concepts

Before you get started, it is useful to be familiar with some of the concepts used in the platform.

### Road Network Region

Road Network Region is a group of interconnected road network objects, including Links, Intersections, Detectors, and others.
Each Region is completely separate from one another.

Currently, we have 4 regions in the platform: Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Mecca.

### Intersections and Links

A Link is a stretch of road that connects two Intersections. Note that a single road can consist of multiple Links.

An Intersection is a junction where two or more Links meet, even if the two Links are of the same road. For example, a signalised pedestrian crossing near a tram stop is considered an Intersection.
